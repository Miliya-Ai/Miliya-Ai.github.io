      Dear Hiring Manager,
    </h2>
    <div id="blog">
      <p id="para_0_original">
        My name is Miliya Ai, computer science student at the University of Montreal. I have completed 81/90 credits and
        plan to graduate in May 2024.
      </p>
      <p id="para_0_original">
        I am proficient in several computer languages, such as <b>python, java, html</b>, etc. In addition,
        I am also familiar with the Office suite tools (Word, Excel, etc.), producing PR videos, Unity for creating
        games and animations,
        and many other things. In my university courses, I studied topics such as software engineering, web design, data
        structures, algorithms, operating systems, and so on.
      </p>
      <p id="para_0_original">
        Currently, I am preparing the AppIETS Mobile Challenge and representing the University of Montreal in the
        Ubisoft 2024 University Competition.
        As part of my part-time job, I work as a teaching assistant at the school, where I am responsible for teaching
        assistance each semester.
        My usual tasks include being present in practical work sessions by troubleshooting students' questions,
        correcting homework and invigilating exams.
        During the summer of 2023, I interned at my university's law faculty, where I contributed to the creation of an
        institutional website
        and gained experience with Agile and DevOps. This project allowed me to use technologies such as Bootstrap,
        Django, Python and MySQL to establish the
        law school's online portal. In addition, I also held the position of programming assistant at the Sustainable
        Development Unit at the University of Montreal.
        In this role, I participated in code optimization and standardization, as well as developing features for
        different tools.
      </p>
      <p id="para_0_original">I enjoy communicating and collaborating with others, which allows me to work effectively
        in a team. I consider myself creative,
        imaginative and passionate about problem solving, which allows me to find innovative solutions to complex
        challenges. If I get the job, I will treat my
        work with the greatest effort and responsibility, and I will do my best to improve my work efficiency.
      </p>
      <p id="para_0_original">I am very interested in the opportunity to work in the field of the intersection of
        computer science, animation and video games.
        I would like to start my career doing basic work, to gain experience and continue to develop as a professional.
        While bringing productivity to the organization,
        I can also develop more depth and skill. That's why I'm really looking forward to joining your team.
      </p>
      <p id="para_0_original">
        Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction. If you think I am suitable for your position, please do
        not hesitate to contact me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sincerely,
      </p>
      <p>Miliya Ai</p>
